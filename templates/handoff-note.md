# Handoff Note Template

> From: Vibe Coding Bible, Vol 1 — Appendix N

Create at the end of every significant feature or sprint. Should fit on two screens and answer everything a new engineer needs to start working.

## Template

```markdown
# Handoff Note: [Feature/Sprint Name]

## What This Does
[One paragraph: what the system does, who uses it, why it matters]

## Architecture
[Brief description: what connects to what, who owns what]

## Key Files
- [file1]: [what it does, why it matters]
- [file2]: [what it does, why it matters]

## How to Run
[Commands to start, test, and deploy]

## Current State
- Working: [what is stable]
- Known issues: [what is broken or fragile]
- Next: [what should be built next]

## Decisions Made
- [Decision 1]: [why, and what alternatives were rejected]
- [Decision 2]: [why]

## Operational Notes
- [How to debug the most common failure]
- [Where logs live]
- [How to rollback]
```

**Tired version:** Write three sentences answering: (1) what does it do, (2) what file do I open first, (3) what breaks most often.
