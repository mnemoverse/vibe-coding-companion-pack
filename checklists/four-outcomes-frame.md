# Four Outcomes Frame

> From: Vibe Coding Bible, Vol 1 — Appendix J

Every piece of work you touch should end in exactly one visible state:

| Outcome | Meaning |
|---------|---------|
| **Done** | Completed with proof. No further action. |
| **Failed** | Cannot proceed without a code or config change. Logged. |
| **Needs Attention** | Blocked on external input or a human decision. Escalated. |
| **Not Needed** | Intentionally skipped or superseded. Recorded with reason. |

If you cannot classify your work into one of these four by end of day, something slipped through silently.

The intent is not just "what will I build" but "what visible outcome will exist when I stop."
