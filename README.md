## Using This Pack

**With the book:** Each resource references the appendix it comes from. Read the appendix for context, use the companion file for daily work.

**Without the book:** The checklists and templates work standalone. The prompt library and weekend plans are richer with the book's explanations.

## Versioning

Releases follow the book edition: `v1.0` for the first edition. Updates go to the companion pack first; the book is a stable snapshot.
