# Weekend Build Plans

> From: Vibe Coding Bible, Vol 1 — Appendix U

10 time-boxed practice sessions. Each plan has three versions:

- **2h** — The minimum viable session. You'll finish something.
- **6h** — A solid half-day. Real progress.
- **12h** — A full weekend day. Ship-quality output.

**Pick the version you can finish.** A completed 2h plan beats an abandoned 12h plan.
